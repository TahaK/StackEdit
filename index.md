TFF implements [Federated Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) to calculate averages of distributed data without collecting it to a central location.

There are [simulated datasets](https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf) data aggregation model update aggregation and model distribution mechanisms in TFF.

New horizons for this approach require [secure aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04482) and [differential privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06963)
